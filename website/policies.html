      <h2 id="accommodations">Accommodations</h2>
      <p>If you expect to need academic accommodations in this class,
        please let me know as early as possible!
        The sooner I know what accommodations you need,
        the easier they are to arrange.</p>
      <h2 id="homework">Homework</h2>
      <p>There will be roughly one homework per week, based on that week's lecture.</p>
      <h4 id="time">Time</h4>
      <p>My goal is for each homework to take approximately two to three hours.
        If homeworks are taking longer than expected,
        please make use of office hours.</p>
      <h4 id="lateness">Lateness</h4>
      <p>You can use up to <b>3</b> late days over the course of the
        semester. Late days are discrete, i.e.,
        there is no difference between 1 hour late and 23 hours late,
        and they will be counted automatically
        (you do not need to email to say you are using one).
        If you find you need more than 3, please email me! Again, the sooner I know,
        the easier it is to find a solution.</p>
      <h4 id="honesty">Honesty</h4>
      <p>Please complete the assignments individually. You are encouraged to
        discuss the lecture material and general language concepts with other
        students, and you may also discuss <em>high-level</em> ideas about the
        homework, but you should not view or copy other students' code.</p>

      You may use
      <a href="https://hoogle.haskell.org/">Hoogle</a> as much as you like,
      but please do not search how to do a problem online, and
      <b>please do not use generative AI tools such as Copilot
        or ChatGPT</b>.</p>

      <h4 id="submission">Submission</h4>Homeworks will be distributed via GitHub and should be submitted via
      Gradescope.

      <h2 id="classwork">Classwork</h2>
      <p>Classes will consist of lecture and active learning components such as
        polls and in-class exercises. Some classes will also have an associated reading.</p>

      <h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>
      <p>The tentative breakdown is 90% homework, 10% class participation.</p>


      <h2 id="attendance">Attendance</h4>
        <p>Attendance is required.
          However, please do not come to class if you think you might have
          COVID-19 or another contagious illness.
          If you are sick or have other extenuating circumstances,
          just email me as soon as you know you cannot make it to class.</p>
